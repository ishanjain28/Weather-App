# Weather-App
A web Application to show weather in a city. Built using ReactJS and jQuery.
The Template has been taken from <a href="https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-boilerplate">react-hot-boilerplate</a>.

You can clone this git and install it like this:
```
npm install
npm start
Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser
```

Please Note that this app is not working as of now. Writing code in a simple file and than using ```browser.min.js``` was easy but now this is different. I am learning this es6 stuff. and ```class, extends``` etc are confusing me a little bit. So, Just come back after some time.. I am sure I can do this.

This app is a solution for the bonfire on ```http://freecodecamp.com```.

Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/gaearon">gaearon</a> for react-hot-loader template. I was totally lost for a while.. :)
